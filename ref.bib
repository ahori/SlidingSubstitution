    abstract = { The user-level failure mitigation (ULFM) interface has been proposed to provide fault-tolerant semantics in the Message Passing Interface (MPI). Previous work presented performance evaluations of ULFM; yet questions related to its programability and applicability, especially to non-trivial, bulk synchronous applications, remain unanswered. In this article, we present our experiences on using ULFM in a case study with a large, highly scalable, bulk synchronous molecular dynamics application to shed light on the advantages and difficulties of this interface to program fault-tolerant MPI applications. We found that, although ULFM is suitable for master–worker applications, it provides few benefits for more common bulk synchronous MPI applications. To address these limitations, we introduce a new, simpler fault-tolerant interface for complex, bulk synchronous MPI programs with better applicability and support than ULFM for application-level recovery mechanisms, such as global rollback. }

abstract = "Exascale studies project reliability challenges for future high-performance computing (HPC) systems. We propose the Global View Resilience (GVR) system, a library that enables applications to add resilience in a portable, application-controlled fashion using versioned distributed arrays. We describe GVR's interfaces to distributed arrays, versioning, and cross-layer error recovery. Using several large applications (OpenMC, the preconditioned conjugate gradient solver PCG, ddcMD, and Chombo), we evaluate the programmer effort to add resilience. The required changes are small (<2% LOC), localized, and machine-independent, requiring no software architecture changes. We also measure the overhead of adding GVR versioning and show that generally overheads <2% are achieved. We conclude that GVR's interfaces and implementation are flexible and portable and create a gentle-slope path to tolerate growing error rates in future systems."

In this paper, we prove that a lower limit exists for the reduction of the B/F attainable by temporal blocking, under certain conditions. We introduce the PiTCH tiling, an example of temporal blocking method that achieves the optimal B/F ratio. We estimate the performance of PiTCH tiling for various stencil applications on several modern CPUs. We show that PiTCH tiling achieves 1.5<2 times better B/F reduction in three-dimensional applications, compared to other temporal blocking schemes. We also show that PiTCH tiling can remove the bandwidth bottleneck from most of the stencil applications considered."

abstract="We explore the post-recovery efficiency of shrinking and non-shrinking recovery schemes on high performance computing systems using a synthetic benchmark. We study the impact of network topology on post-recovery communication performance. Our experiments on the IBM BG/Q System Mira show that shrinking recovery can deliver up to 7.5 {\%} better efficiency for neighbor communication pattern, as the non-shrinking recovery can reduce communication performance. We expected a similar situation for our synthetic benchmark with collective communication, but the situation is quite different. Both shrinking and non-shrinking recovery reduce MPI performance (MPICH3.1) dramatically on collective communication; up to 14{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}worse, swamping any differences between the two approaches. This suggests that making MPI performance less sensitive to irregularity in performance and communicator size are critical for both recovery approaches.",

	abstract = {<p>Resilience is a major roadblock for HPC executions on future exascale systems. These systems will typically gather millions of CPU cores running up to a billion threads. Projections from current large systems and technology evolution predict errors will happen in exascale systems many times per day. These errors will propagate and generate various kinds of malfunctions, from simple process crashes to result corruptions.<br />
	The past five years have seen extraordinary technical progress in many domains related to exascale resilience. Several technical options, initially considered inapplicable or unrealistic in the HPC context, have demonstrated surprising successes. Despite this progress, the exascale resilience problem is not solved, and the community is still facing the difficult challenge of ensuring that exascale applications complete and generate correct results while running on unstable systems. Since 2009, many workshops, studies, and reports have improved the definition of the resilience problem and provided refined recommendations. Some projections made during the previous decades and some priorities established from these projections need to be revised. This paper surveys what the community has learned in the past five years and summarizes the research problems still considered critical by the HPC community.<br />

abstract ={As supercomputers are entering an era of massive parallelism where the frequency of faults is increasing, the MPI Standard remains distressingly vague on the consequence of failures on MPI communications. Advanced fault-tolerance techniques have the potential to prevent full-scale application restart and therefore lower the cost incurred for each failure, but they demand from MPI the capability to detect failures and resume communications afterward. In this paper, we present a set of extensions to MPI that allow communication capabilities to be restored, while maintaining the extreme level of performance to which MPI users have become accustomed. The motivation behind the design choices are weighted against alternatives, a task that requires simultaneously considering MPI from the viewpoint of both the user and the implementor. The usability of the interfaces for expressing advanced recovery techniques is then discussed, including the difficult issue of enabling separate software layers to coordinate their recovery.},
