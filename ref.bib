	abstract = {<p>Resilience is a major roadblock for HPC executions on future exascale systems. These systems will typically gather millions of CPU cores running up to a billion threads. Projections from current large systems and technology evolution predict errors will happen in exascale systems many times per day. These errors will propagate and generate various kinds of malfunctions, from simple process crashes to result corruptions.<br />
	The past five years have seen extraordinary technical progress in many domains related to exascale resilience. Several technical options, initially considered inapplicable or unrealistic in the HPC context, have demonstrated surprising successes. Despite this progress, the exascale resilience problem is not solved, and the community is still facing the difficult challenge of ensuring that exascale applications complete and generate correct results while running on unstable systems. Since 2009, many workshops, studies, and reports have improved the definition of the resilience problem and provided refined recommendations. Some projections made during the previous decades and some priorities established from these projections need to be revised. This paper surveys what the community has learned in the past five years and summarizes the research problems still considered critical by the HPC community.<br />

abstract ={As supercomputers are entering an era of massive parallelism where the frequency of faults is increasing, the MPI Standard remains distressingly vague on the consequence of failures on MPI communications. Advanced fault-tolerance techniques have the potential to prevent full-scale application restart and therefore lower the cost incurred for each failure, but they demand from MPI the capability to detect failures and resume communications afterward. In this paper, we present a set of extensions to MPI that allow communication capabilities to be restored, while maintaining the extreme level of performance to which MPI users have become accustomed. The motivation behind the design choices are weighted against alternatives, a task that requires simultaneously considering MPI from the viewpoint of both the user and the implementor. The usability of the interfaces for expressing advanced recovery techniques is then discussed, including the difficult issue of enabling separate software layers to coordinate their recovery.},
